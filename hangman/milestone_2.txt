# Fruit Guessing Game

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates user input validation and random selection from a list. It asks the user to enter a single letter, validates the input, and then randomly selects a fruit from a list of favorite fruits. If the input is valid, it prints "Good guess!" along with the randomly selected fruit. If the input is not valid, it prints "Oops! That is not a valid input."
